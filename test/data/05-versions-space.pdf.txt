  ACHIEVEMENTS  
 
➢ Received  the  Best  Employee  Award  for  the  year  2016-17 for successfully establishing company’s 
new Service line “Online Admissions and Application Systems”. The project had 2, 13,879 and 
3,03,496 applicants in the year 2014 and 2015 respectively and was a Cash Cow for the Company in 
both years 
 
 I started with OKCL at its nascent stage. i.e when the firm had just began its presence in Odisha. The firm's aim is to    
provide Rural IT literacy in the state and I have been a part of it from past 2 years as the Project Manager. 
I am born and brought up in the state so, Odiya comes naturally to me. Along with that I am comfortable with Hindi 
and English too. 
 
To start with I have worked with larger projects (examples) at district levels already and I have been able to effectively 
overcome any challenges that I have faced over these years- for an instance, the biggest challenge that I faced........ 
 
To continue.. I am a self driven person and I work with minimal intervention and push in a top down environment. I m 
comfortable and also consider myself able enough to drive any project to completion with or without a team. 
Additionally, I have also managed a team of people and have been able to timely deliver on any project or activity that 
I have been assigned with or have taken up individually. 
 
I have closely worked with IAS officers/govt officials etc within the State Govt to drive in ideas, present inputs and 
handle   negotiations   which   have   affected  in   positive   results.   I   also   believe   in   proactive   approach   to   any 
problem/situation. Would like to cite an example....... 
 
I have travelled to many districts in Odisha to set up Learning centres and check their operations and wellbeing. Doing 
follow up on their stability.and dealing with challenges is a major part of my KRA's. What I also learned during these 
travels are that, people just need to reach out to the right set of people for their problems and I completely respect 
PAD's vision to create such channels and provide effective reach and consulting to those in need and create a better 
environment.
